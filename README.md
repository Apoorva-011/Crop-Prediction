**🌾 Crop Recommendation System**

**Overview**


The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to plant. By analyzing critical factors such as soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system predicts the optimal crop for a given set of environmental conditions. This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity, promote sustainable farming, and empower farmers with accessible technology.

**🚀 Features**


Accurate Crop Predictions: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier for precise crop recommendations based on environmental and soil data.
User-Friendly Web Interface: Built with Flask, the application provides an easy-to-use platform for farmers to input data and receive real-time recommendations.
Data-Driven Insights: Helps farmers make informed decisions, improving yield and optimizing resource use.
Accessible Anywhere: Lightweight, web-based application designed to work on various devices.

**🛠️ Technology Stack**


Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks: Flask (for the web application)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib 

**🚀 How to Run**


Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
